# Don't Know the Way (Dunno The Way)

This project aims to auto-generate airways for a given Air Space where one can track the locations of aircraft within it.
The focus of this project is the Brazilian Air Space. However, the project is designed for other Air Spaces as well. The locations and other information about the aircraft are given by ADS-B receivers, and the air routes generated represent the most used ones.
